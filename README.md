# BlinkGen

BlinkGen is a portfolio-grade Next.js app to generate Solana Blinks (social links) that allow donations or ticket purchases directly from the social feed.

Phases:
- Phase 1: Architecture & Data Flow (design)
- Phase 2: Project setup & dependencies (scaffold) ✅
- Phase 3: Implement Action API (GET/POST + transaction build)
- Phase 4: Frontend generator UI & preview
- Phase 5: Validation & deployment

Local dev commands (once dependencies are installed):
- npm run dev

See the project board (TODOs) in the repo for next steps.
